title: High Utility Product Recommendations
---

Inspired by [Sam Bowman](https://www.sambowman.co/p/things-i-recommend-you-buy-and-use?r=75h33&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web), a list of consumer products I derive a ton of benefit from. I recommend them if your preferences are at least vaguely similar to mine.

## Breville Control Freak -- $1500 (curently [$1200](https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/specialty-appliances/cmc850.html?utm_campaign=ChefSteps))

The best stove burner, induction or otherwise. Bad news first: it's really expensive! Good news: it's so good you'll be ruined for other burners and stoves. This product is the reason I wanted to make this list. At its heart, the Control Freak is "just" a normal plug-in induction burner with one key difference: there's a pan temperature sensor built in, and you control the burner by directly setting the pan's target temperature.

In most (all?) other stoves/burners, your control adjusts the power output of the burner: flame size / amount of gas / power to an electric coil or electromagnet. This in turn determines the pan temperature based on some complicated interaction between stove power output, pan materials, ambient conditions, pan contents, etc. But it's the pan's _temperature_ that determines how your food cooks! With the Control Freak, rather than trying to intuit the causal chain `power knob => power output => pan temp = cooking behavior`, you just directly set `pan temp = cooking behavior`.

An example of how this matters: let's say you want to caramelize onions. First you need to drive off water (boils at 212F) from the raw onions, which are quite watery. Then you need a moderate temperature which allows the onions to develop color and flavor without scorching. On a traditional stove, you have three options: (1) babysit the onions by starting at a high power to drive off water and then constantly adjusting temperature; (2) use high power throughout and burn your onions; (3) use low power throughout and have the process take hours. With the Control Freak, just set your target temp to 270F or so and walk away. The Control Freak will start by running at full blast to get your pan from room temp to 212F, then the boiling onion water will cool the pan as the burner continues at full blast, and once the water is driven off and the temperature starts rising past boiling, the Control Freak will gradually taper power until the pan temp arrives at 270F. Stir once in a while if you feel like it.

A few other use cases where I personally find the Control Freak very helpful:
* Making pancakes. I like the cast iron at 260F for pancakes (it's an unusual recipe, a story for another post). On my regular stove I start at high power, check the pan temp manually with an infrared thermometer, and tweak the power downwards as the temp rises. Hopefully I don't overheat the pan while making the batter. With the Control Freak, I just set the temp to 260F.
* Browning butter. This is just like the caramelized onions: 250F to drive off all the water without scorching the milk proteins.
* Making custards, curds, ice cream bases, etc. Set the pan temp just a few degrees higher than your target temp, and your eggs won't scramble.
* Simmering sauces. Just set the pan temp to 185F or so and get a nice simmer. In contrast I've found that other burners with discrete power levels might not have a power level that corresponds to a perfect simmer with my exact pot and contents, and other burners with continuous dials (ie gas stoves) require super finicky minute adjustments to get the level dialed inâ€”and that level changes as the sauce reduces anyway.
* Deep frying. Adding food to hot oil rapidly drops the temperature, so for the best frying result you should way increase power when food is added and taper down as boiling decreases. This requires a bunch of manual adjustment, which the Control Freak does automatically.
* Searing. For best results, you want a quite hot pan but not "everything becomes instantly charred oh wow my smoke alarm is so loud how do I turn that off yikes better open a window" hot. You can fiddle with power levels and infrared thermometers, or you can set your Control Freak to just below the smoke point of your fat of choice.
* Brewing tea. I like a lowish-temperature brew on most teas, which seems to bring out more delicate floral notes. Control Freak at 170F for 6 minutes or so is solid.

The Control Freak also has solid quality of life features. Its electromagnet is large, so it heats pans evenly; it has a pan sensor and turns the magnet off when you lift the pan; its controls are intuitive and tactile and satisfying; it's easy to clean (see below on this being induction in general's killer feature). Slight downsides, price aside, are that it's large and the fan runs for a while after you're done cooking.

## Foot roller -- [$35](https://rollrecovery.com/products/r3)
One of my feet has been stiff for years and, post knee surgery, perpetually achey. This roller is better than a lacross ball at digging into the right parts of the foot without slipping around.
