Since this is a vaguely-professional-adjacent website, I'm supposed to write "I am" followed by a description of my day job. I am a research scientist at the [Nucleic Acid Observatory](https://naobservatory.org/). Until recently, I was the VP of engineering and data science at [Zoba](https://www.zoba.com). Before joining Zoba, I did a PhD at MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu) working with [Carolina Osorio](https://www.carolinaosorio.net/).

I am particularly excited about vaccines and public health, biotech, low carbon energy (nuclear and otherwise), space exploration, urban transportation, building more housing, global development, and effective philanthropy. If you want to chat, definitely drop me a line.

Strictly recreationally, I am a terrible bassoonist, a pretty decent baker, a bike radical, and a Phillies fan.
