Since this is a semi-professional website, I'm supposed to write "I am" followed by a description of my day job. I am the lead data scientist at [Zoba](https://www.zoba.com). Until recently, I was a PhD student in MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu) working with [Carolina Osorio](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/carolina-osorio/).

I am particularly excited about space exploration, vaccines and public health, low carbon energy (nuclear and otherwise), global development, and effective philanthropy. At the moment I'm not looking for a job, but if you want to chat about these or related topics, definitely drop me a line.

Strictly recreationally, I am a terrible bassoonist, a pretty decent baker, and a Phillies fan.
