Since this is a vaguely-professional-adjacent website, I'm supposed to write "I am" followed by a description of my day job. I am actually on the job market right now! Until recently, I was the VP of engineering and data science at [Zoba](https://www.zoba.com). Before joining Zoba, I did a PhD at MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu) working with [Carolina Osorio](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/carolina-osorio/).

I am particularly excited about vaccines and public health, biotech, low carbon energy (nuclear and otherwise), space exploration, urban transportation, building more housing, global development, and effective philanthropy. If you have a lead on a data science or data-flavored-software role in these or related fields, or just want to chat, definitely drop me a line.

Strictly recreationally, I am a terrible bassoonist, a pretty decent baker, and a Phillies fan.
