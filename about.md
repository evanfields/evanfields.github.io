Since this is a semi-professional website, I'm supposed to write "I am" followed by a description of my day job. I am a PhD student in MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu) working with [Carolina Osorio](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/carolina-osorio/).

I am particularly excited about space exploration, vaccines and public health, low carbon energy (nuclear and otherwise), and global development. If you know of data science / statistics / optimization / etc. opportunities in these or related fields, please get in touch - especially if that opportunity is arriving ~late 2018.

Strictly recreationally, I am a terrible bassoonist, a pretty decent baker, and a nascent Phillies fan.
